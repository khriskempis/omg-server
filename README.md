# OMG - Oh My Good's Card game

This app is based on the Oh My Goods card game, which is a resource management card game where players compete to build various workshops and generate the most money.
This repo is meant to store the server code for the OMG app.

to test if it's working:

after cloning the repo install dependencies

```sh
$ npm install
```

start the server:

```sh
$ npm start
```

use PostMan to make a GET request to the url "localhost:8080/omg-api" and you should get a response back

alternatively you can run the app with nodemon which is a library that restarts the server whenever you save the project

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

### Happy Coding!
