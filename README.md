# OMG - Oh My Good's Card game

This app is based on the Oh My Goods card game, which is a resource management card game where players compete to build various workshops and generate the most money.

This repo is meant to store the server code for the OMG app.

### Getting Started

after cloning the repo install dependencies

```sh
$ npm install
```

start the server:

```sh
$ npm start
```

use PostMan to make a GET request to the url "localhost:8080/omg-api" and you should get a response back

alternatively you can run the app with nodemon which is a library that restarts the server whenever you save the project

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

#### Navigating the Project

The project is still a work in progress and needs updated tests.
The `index.js` file is were I was testing how the different objects would communicate with each other and manipulate data as if an endpoint was calling them. The code is messy so beware.

### Happy Coding!
